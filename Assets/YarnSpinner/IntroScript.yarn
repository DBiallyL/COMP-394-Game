Poor, unfortunate little thing...
Cursed like the others to wander the night.
Lost,
Soulless,
Blind.
But you seem different from the others.
Come to me, Sightless One. I can help you leave.
For a price.

Let's strike a deal. A soul is a precious commodity here--beautifully sweet and delectable.
Bring me the souls the Dreamers hoard. In exchange, I will help you get your soul back to get you out of this place.
I swear on my name as a Merchant. 
Do we have a deal?

-> Who are you and where am I?
    <<jump Question>>
-> Fine.
    <<jump Done>>

title: Question

Questions, questions.
I am called the Night Merchant by many, though few left are able to call me at all.
Poor souls trapped here in the Nightmare have all but lost their minds. Pray you don't meet the same fate.
But enough chit-chat. Have we a deal?

-> Fine.
    <<jump Done>>

Ehehehehe......
Excellent.
Go forth then, Sightless One.
Don't let the Bedbugs bite!
