# COMP 394 Game
 
This project uses the HardLight2D asset for enemy light cones (from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/hard-light-2d-152208#description) and the NavMeshPlus github repo for enemy navigation (from https://github.com/h8man/NavMeshPlus). YarnSpinner was used to implement the dialogue (https://yarnspinner.dev/).
